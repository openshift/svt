# OpenShift "gold image" Provisioner

To reduce the time it takes to build out an OpenShift environment, and facilitate automated testing we need to bake several packages, configurations and containers into a RHEL instance.

The image provisioner will support AWS and OpenStack, and be automated with Ansible.  The following Ansible roles are run on an instance:

- filesystem juggling to allow for thinpool in base RHEL cloud image
- RHEL OS setup (install latest packages, ssh keys)
- clone necessary git repos
- collectd-install (install and configure collectd)
- docker-config (setup storage)
- repo-install (setup custom yum repos)
- pbench-install (install and configure [pbench](https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench))
- aos-ansible (pull down supporting container images)
- openshift-rpm-install (install openshift RPMs, but do not configure)

This repo includes a set of playbooks that work in two phases, depending on what type of image you're generating.

1. generate an image (openstack/kvm/ec2)
2. customize the image (done via ansible, so requires only ssh and passwordless keys)

Instructions:

You need a system capable of running KVM guests, and *you have to be root* on that system to do some of the filesystem resizing operations (sudo did not seem to work, but we will eventually make this work).

```
$ sudo su -
# cd $HOME
# git clone https://github.com/openshift/svt
# cd svt/image_provisioner
(customize the inventory file)
# ansible-playbook -i inventory/test playbooks/setup-image.yaml
```

This takes about 2 minutes and results with an image in the /tmp directory.

Next, import the qcow2 into local libvirt:
```
# export NAME=gold ; virt-install --import --name $NAME --ram 4096 --vcpus 4 --disk path=/tmp/rhel-guest-image-7.2-20160302.0.x86_64.qcow2_resized_2016-07-20.qcow2 --disk path=/tmp/cidata.iso,device=cdrom --network bridge=br0 --graphics vnc --check path_in_use=off --noautoconsole --os-variant rhel7
```

Login and get IP address
```
# virsh console gold
```

Feed that IP into the next playbook which will run all the ansible roles in this repo.  Time depends on speed to pull images.  The QE team has an ARP cache snoop that will obviate this step eventually.

```
# ansible-playbook -i inventory/test playbooks/provision_gold_images.yaml
```

Shutdown the guest and sync it to your target environment.  Compression steps are optional.
```
# virsh shutdown gold
# time lzop -1 -o /tmp/2016-07-23-ocp-3.3.0.9-gold.lzo /tmp/rhel-guest-image-7.2-20160302.0.x86_64.qcow2_resized_2016-07-21.qcow2
# scp -i /root/env_4.key -r /tmp/2016-07-23-ocp-3.3.0.9-gold.lzo root@10.2.1.218:/home/stack/
# time lzop -d 2016-07-23-ocp-3.3.0.9-gold.lzo
# time glance image-create --name 2016-07-23-ocp-3.3.0.9 --disk-format qcow2 --container-format bare --file 2016-07-23-ocp-3.3.0.9-gold --visibility public
```

EC2 instructions coming soon.
