# Storage test:  Performance Benchmarking MongoDB with [YCSB](https://github.com/brianfrankcooper/YCSB) on OpenShift Container Platform (OCP)  

## Prerequisites

Prepare cluster with **pbench** to gather results

Clone **svt** repository 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/svt.git
``` 

```sh
$ cd storage/mongodb 
    $ ./runmongo.sh
```

**kubeconfig** Before start be sure `oc` client will use correct authorization:

```sh
export KUBECONFIG=/path/to/auth/kubeconfig
```

Setup params in [external_vars.yaml](external_vars.yaml) you want to use during the test.

If executed this way, it will pick up values specified in **external_vars.yaml** an example of **external_vars.yaml** is showed below 

```

---
test_project_name: storage-test-mongo
test_project_number: 10
delete_test_project_before_test: true
tmp_folder: /tmp/mongodb-test
MEMORY_LIMIT: 1024Mi
MONGODB_USER: redhat
MONGODB_PASSWORD: redhat
MONGODB_DATABASE: testdb
VOLUME_CAPACITY: 10Gi 
STORAGE_CLASS_NAME: glusterfs-storage
MONGODB_VERSION: 3.2
iteration: 10
ycsb_threads: 10,20
workload: workloada
recordcount: 1000       
operationcount: 1000
distribution: uniform
```

If necessary adapt **external_vars.yaml** to correspond specific test needs 

This example will allocate **1024Mi** RAM for MongoDB pod, run YCSB with 10,20 threads, execute **workloada** , run 10 iterations with 
**recordcount=1000** , **operationcount=1000**
Storage used for Mongodb pod will be carved from storageclass with name **gluster-storage** and size of PVC will be  **10Gi** 
YCSB **uniform** distribution will be used and 10 test projects will be created 

It is also possible to execute test with various values for memory for MongoDB pod all in one run, eg.

```

test_project_name: storage-test-mongo
test_project_number: 10
delete_test_project_before_test: true
tmp_folder: /tmp/mongodb-test
MEMORY_LIMIT: 512Mi,1024Mi,2048Mi,4096Mi
MONGODB_USER: redhat
MONGODB_PASSWORD: redhat
MONGODB_DATABASE: testdb
VOLUME_CAPACITY: 10Gi 
STORAGE_CLASS_NAME: glusterfs-storage
MONGODB_VERSION: 3.2
iteration: 10
ycsb_threads: 10,20,30,40
workload: workloada
recordcount: 1000       
operationcount: 1000
distribution: uniform
```

This will execute YCSB test against MongoDB pod for various combination

- run workloada,workloadb,workloadc,workloade tests with 512 MB of RAM for MongoDB and with 10,20,30,40 YCSB threads
- run workloada,workloadb,workloadc,workloade tests with 1024 MB of RAM for MongoDB pod and with 10,20,30,40 YCSB threads
- follow same matrix for other **MEMORY_LIMITS** 

**Important:** :exclamation:

If **operationcount** and **recordcount** are hight, then in order for test to work it is necessary to 
start test with bigger PVC size. 

You can run all YCSB workloads: **workloada**, **workloadb**, **workloadc**, **workloadd**, **workloade**, **workloadf**, **workload_template** but **workloadd** and **workloade** fail to run for iterations more than one in the same DB!
