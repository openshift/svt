# OpenShift Quickstart Apps

## How to use

### Included files

For each application there are the following files:
- \<app>-\<db>.json
- \<app>-\<db>-pv.json
- \<app>-\<db>-deploy.json
- \<app>-\<db>-pv-deploy.json
- \<app>-build.json

Each application has two permutations, one with persistent volumes and one without persistent volumes. 

Within each permutation there is a complete template that includes a BuildConfig and ImageStream and a deploy only template that omits the build step. The deploy only template assumes that the container image has already been built in the `openshift` namespace. 

### cluster-loader

In the cluster-loader config directory there are corresponding cluster-loader configs for the above permutations of quickstart templates.

- master-vert.json
- master-vert-pv.json
- master-vert-deploy.json
- master-vert-pv-deploy.json

Example usage:
```
# python cluster-loader.py -f config/master-vert-pv.yaml
```

## Requirements and Recommendations 

### Router

To access routes from an external machine such as a server running JMeter or your workstation, dnsmasq needs to be configured on that system. 

1. Add a dnsmasq configuration file to `/etc/dnsmasq.d/` :
```
# Wildcard DNS for OpenShift Applications - Points to Router
address=/<routing-config-subdomain>/<router-host-ip-addr>
```

2. Update `/etc/resolv.conf` to point to local dnsmasq instance:
```
nameserver 127.0.0.1
<other-nameservers>
```

### Registry

- If on AWS, best to use an io1 volume instead of gp2

- Best to use a persistent volume: https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/install_config/install/docker_registry.html#registry-production-use

### Docker Storage

- If on AWS, best to use an io1 volume for the docker storage volume on all OSE nodes instead of gp2

## About the Quickstarts

### CakePHP

Source: https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex

Simple landing page app with a page view counter that is written to the database. App code must be modified to [enable database example](https://github.com/openshift/cakephp-ex#enabling-the-database-example).

### Dancer

Source: https://github.com/openshift/dancer-ex

Contact list app that keeps track of names and email addresses. App code must be modified to [enable database example](https://github.com/openshift/dancer-ex#enabling-the-database-sample).

Example HTTP request to write data: 
```
# curl -XPOST -d "name=perf" -d "email=perf@redhat.com" http://dancer-mysql-example-dancer-mysql0.cloudapps.ose.com/
```

### DayTrader

Source: https://github.com/siamaksade/daytrader

DayTrader is benchmark application built around the paradigm of an online stock trading system.  The application needs to be first [configured](http://<app_route_host>/daytrader/configure.html). 

### Django

Source: https://github.com/openshift/django-ex

Simple landing page app with a page view counter that is written to the database.

### EAP

Source: https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-examples

Todo app that keeps track of task summary and description. 

Example HTTP request to write data:
```
# curl -XPOST -d "summary=get+stuff+done" -d "description=omg+so+many+things" http://jws-app-tomcat8-mongodb0.cloudapps.ose.com/
```

### NodeJS

Source: https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex

Simple landing page app with a page view counter that is written to the database.

### Rails

Source: https://github.com/openshift/rails-ex

Blog posting app. 

TODO: figure out how to progammatically send requests, app uses cookies to validate requests. 

### Tomcat

Source: https://github.com/jboss-openshift/openshift-examples

Todo app that keeps track of task summary and description. 

Example HTTP request to write data:
```
# curl -XPOST -d "summary=get+stuff+done" -d "description=omg+so+many+things" http://jws-app-tomcat8-mongodb0.cloudapps.ose.com/
```

## Issues

### Dynamic Provisioning 

- Application templates that use persistent volumes have been modified to use dynamic provisioning

- As of OpenShift Enterprise 3.2, dynamic provisioning only works with [Cinder, Amazon EBS, and GCE volumes](https://docs.openshift.com/enterprise/3.2/install_config/persistent_storage/dynamically_provisioning_pvs.html#enabling-provisioner-plugins)

- Dynamic provisioning on Amazon EBS is [hardcoded](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/pkg/volume/aws_ebs/aws_ebs.go#L414) to use `ext4` filesystem

### Application Templates are Copied from Upstream

- Complete templates have been modified to use dynamic provisioning for persistent volumes

- Complete templates have been edited down to create seperate build and deploy templates

- cluster-loader doesn't support creating templates from URLs, this would simplify keeping templates up-to-date by pointing to only the upstream versions

- Templates source: https://github.com/openshift/online/tree/master/templates/examples

### Forked Quickstarts

The following quickstarts need to be forked from their upstream repos to enable the database example to work:

- [cakephp](https://github.com/redhat-performance/cakephp-ex)

- [dancer](https://github.com/redhat-performance/dancer-ex)

### Poor Performance with Java Based Apps

The Tomcat and EAP based apps handle a considerably lower number of requests per second compared to the other quickstart apps. During preliminary testing, these apps could only handle about 4.1 requests per second before returning errors. This may be due to requests being blocked on disk access, increasing memory utilization until the pod memory limit is reached. This causes the pod to be repeatedly restarted during the test and the majority of requests fail.
