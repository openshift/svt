=== Run Sysbench Benchmark Test Inside OCP Pod(s)

*This document assume that all commands in below text are run on fully functional and running OCP installation with proper storage configured
 storage classes and dynamic provisioning. Refer to OCP documentation for instructions how to do configure
 storage classes and dynamic storage provisioning*

In this document it will be described what is necessary to run sysbench benchmark inside OCP pods

==== Create Docker Images

It is first necessary to build *sysbench* docker images. The docker files are prepared for this for
https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/dockerfiles/centos6[centos6]
and https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/dockerfiles/centos7[centos7]

To build images run below commands

```
# docker run -t sysbenchcentos7 - < centos7
# docker run -t sysbenchcentos6 - < centos6
```

Ensure that these images are present on all nodes where sysbench pods are supposed to run. This can be achieved either by building them on
nodes directly, or building and pushing to registry which is used by OCP nodes and thus enable them to consume image from there

During image build step it will get script https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/sysbenchose.sh[sysbenchose.sh]
inside container and it will be used for running sysbench inside pods

==== Creating Sysbench Test Pods

After successful creation of docker images, we can create sysbench pods, there are two options

- create pods manually based on above crated docker image
- create pods using https://github.com/openshift/svt[clusterloader] as described below

in next section it will be described how to create pods using *clusterloader* tool

```
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/svt
$ cd svt/openshift_scalability
$ python cluster-loader.py -f <template_file>
```

https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/sysbench-template.json[sysbench template_file] and
https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/sysbench-parameters.yaml[sysbench parameters file] can be as these two files

below is example of *sysbench-parameters.yaml* file and that file is used as input for clusterloader

```
projects:
  - num: 1
    basename: sysbench
    tuning: default
    templates:
      - num: 1
        file: ./sysbench-template.json
        parameters:
        # oltp parameters
          - STORAGE_CLASS: "storageclass" # this is name of storage class to use
          - STORAGE_SIZE: "3Gi" # this is size of PVC mounted inside pod
          - MOUNT_PATH: "/mnt/pvcmount"
          - OLTP: "100000"

        # cpu parameters
          - CPU_PRIME: "10000"
          - MAX_REQ: "10000"

        # general parameters
          - THREADS: "1,2,4,8,16,24,48"
          - DOCKER_IMAGE: "dockerimage"
          - TESTTYPE: "cpu"
          - SYSBENCH_RESULTS: "/var/sysbench_results"

tuningsets:
  - name: default
    pods:
      stepping:
        stepsize: 5
        pause: 0 min
      rate_limit:
        delay: 0 ms

```

==== Running Sysbench Test in Pbench Mode

https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench[Pbench tool] offers option to collect system data
during test execution. With system data we mean different system / performance data collected with
general tools like `sar`, `iostat`, `mpstat` and many others. For detailed list, refer to pbench https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/tree/master/agent/tool-scripts[tool scripts]

Pbench has `pbench-user-benchmark` https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/bench-scripts/pbench-user-benchmark[script]
It is possible to use `pbench-user-benchmark` script to run sysbench test and at same time to collect system data
during test execution.

`pbench-user-benchmark` exports https://github.com/distributed-system-analysis/pbench/blob/master/agent/bench-scripts/pbench-user-benchmark#L107[benchmark_run_dir]
variable and it can be used as value for `SYSBENCH_RESULTS` to ensure that sysbench data are
collected to pbench directory too.

The way we then start test would be

```
# pbench-user-benchmark --config="sysbench_test" -- ./runsys.sh <projectName>.0
```

with `runsys.sh` as in this https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ekuric/openshift/master/sysbench/runsys.sh[example]

Variable `SYSBENCH_RESULTS` for this test case would be
```
SYSBENCH_RESULTS: "$benchmark_run_dir/tools-default/sysbench_results"
```

==== Sysbench-parameters.yaml explanation

From above *sysbench-parameters.yaml* we want to do

- create 1 project  ( *num* )
- create 1 pod in project ( *templates-> num* )
- use template sysbench-template.json ( *file* )
- use storageclass ( *parameters->STORAGE_CLASS* ) - storage class has to be configured in advance, check
` oc get storageclass` and ensure it exist
- storage size of 3Gi ( *parametres ->  STORAGE_SIZE* )
- mount storage inside pod to MOUNT_PATH ( *paremetrs -> MOUNT_PATH*) - this location
will be used for mariadb `data` and `metadata` directories
- use docker image ( *parameters-> DOCKER_IMAGE*) what docker image to use, it has to be build with
sysbench preinstalled and `sysbenchose.sh` script inside it - refer dockerfiles for more details
- number of sysbench threads - comma separated list of numbers , eg ( *parameters -> THREADS*),
`THREADS:"1,2,4,8` will run sysbench with 1,2,4,8 sysbench threads
- sysbench result location (*parameters-> SYSBENCH_RESULTS* ) this is location where
sysbench results will be saved, results will be located on host where
sysbench pod was running during sysbench pod execution
- OLTP - this is value for ` â€“oltp-table-size ` sysbench parameter ( *parameters -> OLTP* )
- CPU_PRIME - for Sysbench CPU test, this is `prime` number to caclulate - refer to sysbench documentation
- MAX_REQ - maximum number of requests , used in Sysbench CPU test type
- TESTTYPE - We have support for `CPU` and `OLTP` sysbench test types. We can run
either `CPU` (TESTTYPE: "cpu") , or `OLTP` ( TESTTYPE: "oltp", or both ( TESTTYPE:"oltpcpu" )
 during test.Pick up desired test and specifiy it in `sysbench-parameters.yaml` file

For full list of all available parameters, refer to https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/sysbench-template.json#L94-L166[sysbench-template.json]
file.

After setting parameters in *sysbench-parameters.yaml* running test can be started as
below

` python cluster-loader.py -f sysbench-parameters.yaml`

This will create sysbench pod and start sysbench test inside the pod. Sysbench pod log example is
showed at this https://gist.github.com/ekuric/5d30eb8d411b08f6b79164f38d86b1af[link]

In this test case, storage was originating from CNS cluster and inside sysbench pod we see below, and it is visible that
sysbench is writing to custom mount location inside sysbench pod specified with `MOUNT_PATH` in parameters file

```
# mount | grep pvcmount
10.16.153.42:vol_0634fd7e484d2620107181184178703d on /mnt/pvcmount type fuse.glusterfs (rw,relatime,user_id=0,group_id=0,default_permissions,allow_other,max_read=131072)
sh-4.2# cd /mnt/pvcmount/
sh-4.2# ls -l
total 8
drwxr-sr-x. 2 root 2000 4096 May  5 10:02 data
drwxr-sr-x. 2 root 2000 4096 May  5 10:02 datalog
```

==== Sysbench Test Result

Results from sysbench test will be saved on host where sysbench pod was running in
`SYSBENCH_RESULTS` location in directory which is https://github.com/ekuric/openshift/blob/master/sysbench/sysbenchose.sh#L110[$hosname -s] of pod where
it was executed.

For above example *sysbench-parameters.yaml* file results will be saved as showed below



```
# ls -l /var/lib/pbench-agent/pbench-user-benchmark-x.x.x/x/x/sysbench_results
# ls -l
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 2246 May 11 07:02 sysbench_cpu_test_2017-05-11-10-49-36.txt
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 3873 May 11 06:57 sysbench_oltp_test_2017-05-11-10-49-36.txt

```

==== Running Sysbench Test Using `docker run ... ` Approach

It is possible to run sysbench test directly via ` docker run .... ` approach

For this test case generic docker command would be

```
# docker run  --privileged -it -v /results_dir_location/:/results -v /test_run_location/:/home/  <image_name> /root/sysbenchose.sh -d /home -t <THREADS> -o <OLTP> -r /results
```
for example

```
# docker run  --privileged -it -v /home/results/:/results -v /home/test/:/home/  sysbenchrhel7 /root/sysbenchose.sh -d /home -t 12 -o 10000 -r /results
```

Last example will create on host in /home/results/ an directory corresponding hostname of container where
test was executed

Example output

```
# pwd
/home/results/6fa66b93bf60/threads_12
[root@gprfs013 threads_12]# ls -l
total 4
-rw-r--r--. 1 root root 1290 May  5 08:49 test_2017-05-05-12-46-51.log
[root@gprfs013 threads_12]# cat test_2017-05-05-12-46-51.log

==== Known issues
It does not make sense to chellange your fate and to start `1e6` pods
with sysbench inside all of them, legend says it will end bad
