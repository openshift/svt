**addebs.py** script can be used to allocate desired number of EBS volumes and attach them to instance from where
**addebs.py** is executed

**Perquisites are **

- it is necessary in advance to run `aws configure` in order to
have aws credentials properly configure on ec2 machine

```
# pip install awscli
# aws configure
```

- python-boto3 package has to be installed on instance

```
# yum install python-boto3
```


**Usage**

```
# python addebs.py -h
usage: addebs.py [-h] [--volumesize VOLUMESIZE] [--vtype VTYPE]
                 [--region REGION] [--tagprefix TAGPREFIX] --num NUM
                 [--base BASE]

Script to create EBS volumes and attach them to ec2 instance from where this
script is run

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --volumesize VOLUMESIZE
                        size of EBS volume - in GB
  --vtype VTYPE         EBS volume type, default is gp2
  --region REGION       Amazon region - will be ignored and defaults taken if
                        aws configure was ran
  --tagprefix TAGPREFIX
                        tag prefix for EBS volumes, default tag is openshift-
                        testing-EBS_volume_id
  --num NUM             How many EBS volumes, max is 26 devices, eg, devices
                        will be /dev/xvdba-/dev/xvdbz,different sets are
                        possible /dev/xvdb, /dev/xvdc...
  --base BASE           in which range to start adding device, base can be
                        b,c,d ... , eg /dev/xvdba-/dev/xvdbz and here is base
                        which to use /dev/xvdb, same for /dev/xvdc... etc
```

From range `/dev/xvda-/dev/xvdz` devices `/dev/xvda` and `/dev/xvda` will be ignored with this script - it is supposed that
they are already attached to ec2 instance

Other ranges can be be fully used. Keep in mind ec2 http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/volume_limits.html[limitations]

To allocate devices `/dev/xvdc - /dev/xvdz` and attach them to ec2 instance run

```
# python addebs.py --volumesize=1 --vtype=gp2 --tagprefix=ebs_volume_tag --num=24
```

To allocate devices from range `/dev/xvdba  - /dev/xvdbz` run

```
#python addebs.py --volumesize=1 --vtype=gp2 --tagprefix=ebs_volume_tag --num=26 --base=b
```
