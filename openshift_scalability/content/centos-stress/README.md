# centos-stress
CentOS based docker image.

## Prerequisites

To use the workload generator (WLG) image within the [OCP](https://www.openshift.com/container-platform/) environment, it needs to be
made retrievable from a docker registry as `svt/centos-stress` image or built on
OCP nodes hosting the WLG pods.  If you decide to use the latter method, you
need to change
[stress-pod.json](https://github.com/openshift/svt/tree/master/openshift_scalability/content/quickstarts/stress) `"imagePullPolicy"` to `"Never"`.  The WLG image `svt/centos-stress`
can be overriden by an optional
[cluster-loader](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/cluster-loader.py) parameter `WLG_IMAGE`.

OCP nodes hosting WLG pods must be labeled by a `placement=${PLACEMENT}`
label, otherwise the WLG pods will fail to fit any node.  The default value of
`${PLACEMENT}` in [stress-pod.json](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/content/quickstarts/stress/stress-pod.json)
is `test`.

Before running any of the test harnesses synchronised by the cluster-loader [autogen functionality](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/README.md) ensure you can connect from OCP nodes hosting WLG pods to a machine running cluster-loader (OCP master) to TCP port 9090.  This value can be changed by overriding GUN_PORT variable (see
[stress-pod.json](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/content/quickstarts/stress/stress-pod.json)).

## Test harnesses

There are several test harnesses provided by this docker image.  The recommended
way of running them is through the use of the [cluster-loader](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/cluster-loader.py) tool.  All of the test harnesses use a common template
[stress-pod.json](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/content/quickstarts/stress/stress-pod.json), but they typically use their own cluster-loader configuration file.

### JMeter

### mb

This test harness makes use of Multiple-host HTTP(s) Benchmarking tool [mb](https://github.com/jmencak/mb).  [stress-mb.yaml](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/config/stress-mb.yaml) is an example of the cluster-loader configuration file.

#### Sample run

Allow access to cluster-loader autogen synchronisation primitive on port 9090
and label OCP nodes for WLG pods.

```
# firewall-cmd --zone=public --add-port=9090/tcp --permanent && systemctl reload firewalld
$ oc label node ip-172-31-20-98.us-west-2.compute.internal placement=test
```

Build centos-stress docker image.  Note that the step to push the image to a
docker registry is omitted here.

```
$ docker build -t svt/centos-stress ~/svt/openshift_scalability/content/centos-stress
```

Deploy sample (quickstart) applications across OCP cluster nodes.
```
$ cd ~/svt/openshift_scalability
$ ./cluster-loader.py -vf config/master-vert.yaml
```

Choose `RUN_TIME`, `MB_TARGETS` and optionally `WLG_IMAGE` and other
[stress-pod.json](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/content/quickstarts/stress/stress-pod.json) variables as needed.  Start cluster-loader in autogen mode.

```
$ vi config/stress-mb.yaml # edit RUN_TIME, MB_TARGETS, WLG_IMAGE and/or other variables as needed
$ ./cluster-loader.py -vaf config/stress-mb.yaml
```

The results from the WLG pods will be uploaded to the host running cluster-loader to directory defined by an environment variable `benchmark_run_dir`.  If this variable is unset it defaults to `/tmp`.


### wrk

This test harness makes use of a modern HTTP benchmarking tool [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) with support for scripting in LUA. [stress-wrk.yaml](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/config/stress-wrk.yaml) is an example of the cluster-loader configuration file.

#### System tuning

When using the HTTP no keep-alive mode (`WRK_KEEPALIVE` set to `n` in [stress-wrk.yaml](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/config/stress-wrk.yaml)) it is necessary to set kernel configuration
`net.ipv4.tcp_tw_reuse=1` on WLG/wrk client nodes, otherwise the client system
will quickly run out of usable sockets.

#### Performance and limitations

The [wrk](https://github.com/wg/wrk) client was designed to put a significant
amount of load on a single HTTP(S) server.  An optional LuaJIT script can
perform HTTP request generation, response processing, and custom reporting, but
this is at the expense of load it can generate.  However, the amount of load
generated in this way is still very high.  With a
[patch](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/utils/wrk/patches/wrk-4.0.2.diff)
to allow targeting multiple
hosts from LUA scripts, a wrk WLG pod is capable of sending and processing around 30000 HTTP requests per second evenly spread across 2000 routes (i.e. around 15 rps per single route) on an EC2 m4.xlarge VM instance.  Using more than 2000 routes is not advisable.  Note
that increasing the number of clients/connections per thread (WRK_CONNS_PER_THREAD)
is not as expensive as increasing the number of routes/targets (WRK_TARGETS)
for a wrk pod to handle.

While the wrk test harness can be extended by the use of LUA scripts, there
is currently likely to be a wider range of ready-made JMeter plugins to
accomplish certain tasks then custom wrk LUA scripts.

$ cd ~/svt/openshift_scalability
$ ./cluster-loader.py -vf config/master-vert.yaml

[stress-pod.json](https://github.com/openshift/svt/blob/master/openshift_scalability/content/quickstarts/stress/stress-pod.json) variables as needed.  Start cluster-loader in autogen mode.

```
$ vi config/stress-wrk.yaml # edit RUN_TIME, WRK_TARGETS, WLG_IMAGE and/or other variables as needed
$ ./cluster-loader.py -vaf config/stress-wrk.yaml
```

The results from the WLG pods will be uploaded to the host running cluster-loader to directory defined by an environment variable `benchmark_run_dir`.  If this variable is unset it defaults to `/tmp`.
